# boostrap
my personal nord-themed ricing setup (WIP)
## features:
- a dark and icy theme
- 5k wallpaper
- custom ghostwriter theme
- fully configured shell with fish/starship.rs
- themed Spotify and Discord clients 

# installation
installation can be performed by copying the following line to your terminal and executing it

`git clone https://github.com/toasterrepairman/boostrap.git && cd boostrap/ && sh boostrap.sh`

this will clone the repo and run it, installing various helpful tools all themed with the nord color palette
