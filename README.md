# boostrap
my personal nord-themed ricing setup (WIP)
## features:
- a dark and icy theme
- 5k wallpaper
- ~~custom ghostwriter theme~~ removed, since Obsidian has a Nord theme 
- fully configured shell with fish/starship.rs
- themed Spotify and Discord clients 

# prerequisites
ideally this should be installed on a fresh Manjaro Gnome installation. however, any distro with pacman and and the Gnome DE installed should work. it should be compatable with other window managers, but i haven't tested it. this is not compatible with KDE, but you can use the components/commands in here piecemeal to get a similar result if you really want. 

# installation
installation can be performed by copying the following line to your terminal and executing it

`git clone https://github.com/toasterrepairman/boostrap.git && cd boostrap/ && sh boostrap.sh`

this will clone the repo and run it, installing various helpful tools all themed with the nord color palette
