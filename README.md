# boostrap
my personal nord-themed ricing setup (WIP)
## Features:
- a dark and icy theme
- 5k wallpaper
- (coming soon) themed Spotify and Discord clients 

# installation
installation can be performed by copying the following line to your terminal and executing it

`git clone git@github.com:toasterrepairman/boostrap.git && cd boostrap/ && sh boostrap.sh`

this will clone the repo and run it, installing various helpful tools all themed with the nord color palette
